# A Web Server in Rust

 The focus of this project was to leverage the features of the relatively new Rust programming language in order to build a scalable web server. The implementation began as a very basic and naive web server. However, the architecture gradually grew in size as a thread pool was integrated in order to enable parallelization of tasks, priority scheduling was introduced to prevent large file requests from clogging the web server traffic, and server side caching was added to reduce the number of necessary I/O operations. Logging the incoming requests and outgoing response statuses was also implemented across the threads in the thread pool. The ApacheBench tool was used to measure the performance at the various stages of the web serverâ€™s progression. These benchmarks were compared with those of the Apache web server in order to determine whether a Rust web server is capable of matching the scale an existing web server that is widely used today. This initial evaluation suggests that the Rust web server design without the prioritization is comparable and perhaps slightly better in performance than the Apache web server for smaller files. The priority scheduling effectively serves files in order of file size, however, continued work is required to improve the overall performance. Additional work also includes adding other typical features found in existing web servers.
