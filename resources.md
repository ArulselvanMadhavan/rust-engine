We can track the software and hardware versions and other links to useful tutorials here.

Dev Environment:
The Rust compiler runs on, and compiles to, a great number of platforms, though not all platforms are equally supported. Rust's support levels are organized into three tiers, each with a different set of guarantees.

Our setup falls under Tier 1 support.
